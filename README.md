## Empathize: 
The local user.
## Define: 
It provides weather forecasting services with different accuracy depending on whether it is paid or not.
## Ideate:  
### Scenario:
Users need to know the future weather in their city. This project provides users with weather forecasts and provides different accuracy services for free users and paying users.  
### Possible solutions: 
* Collect the data, process it and aggregate it into the appropriate format, then clean it up.

* Focus on analyzing trends in the data, the goal is to select the appropriate features and use Python's statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries to build a linear regression model. Discussion To build a linear regression model, you must make the necessary assumptions and demonstrate how to evaluate the data features to build a robust model and finally test and validate the model.

* Finally, the focus will be on using neural networks. Compare the process of constructing a neural network model and constructing a linear regression model, the results, and accuracy. 
### Key involved stakeholders:
The local user.   
### Key metrics for evaluating: 
Probability of precipitation.  
### Similar or related scenarios: 
Flight delay.
## Test:
Compare the notification with the actual situation.
