## Empathize: 
Local meteorological bureau.

## Define: 
Use weather forecasting to natural disasters warning.

## Ideate:  
### Scenario:
The Meteorological Bureau obtains data such as cloud maps and barometric pressure maps through radar, climate satellites and other equipment. We use these data to predict future weather conditions, and based on these results, provide meteorological bureaus with mountain fire warnings and urban flood warnings to give advise for the Meteorological Bureau.  
### Possible solutions: 
* Collect the data, process it and aggregate it into the appropriate format, then clean it up.

* Focus on analyzing trends in the data, the goal is to select the appropriate features and use Python's statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries to build a linear regression model. Discussion To build a linear regression model, you must make the necessary assumptions and demonstrate how to evaluate the data features to build a robust model and finally test and validate the model.

* Finally, the focus will be on using neural networks. Compare the process of constructing a neural network model and constructing a linear regression model, the results, and accuracy. 
### Key involved stakeholders:
Meteorological Bureau and the public.    
### Key metrics for evaluating: 
Probability of precipitation.  
### Similar or related scenarios: 
Flight delay.

## Prototype: 
Give results through pictures.

## Test: 
Compare the analysis result with the actual situation.
